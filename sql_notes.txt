What is a DBMS?
---------------

A database management system (DBMS) is a software used to store and manage data. It guarantees the quality, durability, and confidentiality of information


RDBMS
-------------

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System

RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows


What is SQL?
-------------

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for data manipulation in a DBMS. In in simple words its used to talk to the data in a DBMS

SQL commands: 

DDL(Data Definition Language)      : Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate
DQL(Data Query Language)           : Select
DML(Data Manipulation Language)    : Insert, Delete, Update
DCL(Data Control Language)         : Grant, Revoke
TCL(Transaction Control Language)  : Commit, Rollback, Save point

Create database:

	create database <database_name>

Change Database:

	use <database_name>

Create Table:
	
	create table product(pid int,pname varchar(100));



Constraints:
------------
Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database
   
	1. Primary key
	2. Not null
	3. Unique
	4. Foreign key
	5. Default
	6. Check 

Constraints could be on :
	
	Table Level	
	Column Level:

Composite Primary key: 

    Composite key, or composite primary key, refers to cases where more than one column is used to specify the primary key of a table.


Numeric Data Type        : INT, FLOAT  

Date and Time Data Type  : DATE, DATETIME

String Data Types        : VARCHAR, CHAR


Import and Export Data
----------------------

Export:
	mysqldump -u username -p database_name > file.sql	
Import: 
	mysql -u username -p database_name < file.sql



Creating Tables:
	
	

1. Get all the employee names only
	select ename from emp;
	
2. Get name, job, salary of the all the employee
    select ename as Name,job as Job, sal as Salary from emp;
     
3. Get name,salary,total_sal (sal + comm) of all employees 
	select ename,sal,comm,sal + ifnull(comm,0) as total_sal from emp;

Where ?

4. Get all the employees who are getting salary is more than 2000

	select * from emp where sal > 2000;

5. Get all the employees who are getting salary is more than 2000 and display in sorting order by salary
	select * from emp where sal > 2000 order by sal desc,empno;
	
6. Get the details of employee who are working for 10 or 20 or 30
	select * from emp where deptno = 10 or deptno = 20 or deptno = 30;
	
#7 Get all employees whose salary is 5000, 1600, 800, 3000
	
    select * from emp where sal= 5000 or sal = 1600 or sal = 800 or sal = 3000;
    select * from emp where sal in(5000,1600,800,3000);
    
#8 Get all the employees who are wokring dept 10 or salary is more than 2000 
	select * from emp where deptno = 10 or sal > 2000;

	select * from emp where sal > 2000 and sal < 5500;

#11 Get the all the employee who are working for dept 10 and getting salary between  1500 to 5000 who has no manager
    select * from emp where deptno = 10 and sal between 1500 and 5000 and mgr is null;
 
#12 Get all the employees whose name starts with letter 'S'
	select * from emp where ename like '____';

#13 Get all the job unique names
